# Dotfiles
Configuration files for various programs I use.

These are far from complete, or even pretty. Most of them are Frankensteined from other dotfiles I find in forums and such. This repository is more geared for keeping all my config files organized for my desktop and laptop.

Take and use what you like. I'll update as I continue to hack away at them.
